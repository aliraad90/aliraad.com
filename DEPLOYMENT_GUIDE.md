# Deployment Guide - Fix for Amplify Backend Issues

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your Amplify deployment is failing because the backend configuration is too complex for automatic deployment.

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use EmailJS (Recommended - Easiest)
1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. Create free account
3. Create email service (Gmail)
4. Create email template
5. Get your credentials and update in `client/src/publicApi.js`

### Option 2: Deploy Lambda Function Manually
1. Go to AWS Lambda Console
2. Create new function
3. Copy code from `lambda/contact-form/index.js`
4. Add nodemailer dependency
5. Update frontend API URL

### Option 3: Use Netlify Functions
1. Switch to Netlify hosting
2. Use `serverless/contact.js` as Netlify function
3. Automatic deployment

## 🎯 Immediate Solution
For now, the mailto fallback is working. Users can still contact you through the form.

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Choose one of the above options
2. Configure the service
3. Update the frontend configuration
4. Test the contact form
